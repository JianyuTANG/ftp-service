# FTP Service

This is the course project of Computer Networking, taught by Prof. Zheng Yang.

The project includes a backend **server** and a frontend GUI **client**, which both follow RFC 955 protocol and can connect to standart client/server.

The server is written by C, using Berkeley API only, while the client is implemented in Python and is powered by PyQt5.

See how to run in server and client directory respectively.
